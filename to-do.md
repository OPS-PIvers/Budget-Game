## ✅ FIXED "Goals" LOADING 
**COMPLETED**: Fixed the Goals loading issue through comprehensive debugging and improvements:

### What was fixed:
- **Root Cause**: Goals were being saved to the Goals sheet but not loading in the Dashboard due to household ID association issues
- **Debug Logging**: Added comprehensive logging throughout the Goals loading data flow (getUserHouseholdId → getGoalsByHousehold → calculateHouseholdGoals)
- **Auto-Household Creation**: Added `ensureUserHasHousehold()` function to automatically create household associations when missing
- **Fallback Logic**: Added functions to detect and fix orphaned goals (goals without proper household associations)
- **Enhanced Error Messaging**: Improved Dashboard error messages with specific diagnostics and actionable steps
- **Diagnostic Tool**: Added "Run Diagnostic" button that shows detailed information about Goals loading status

### Technical improvements made:
1. **Enhanced `getDetailedGoalData()`** - Now auto-creates household if missing
2. **Enhanced `createGoal()`** - Added detailed logging and validation
3. **Enhanced `getUserHouseholdId()`** - Added comprehensive debug logging
4. **Enhanced `getGoalsByHousehold()`** - Added logging and household ID debugging
5. **Added `getOrphanedGoals()`** - Identifies goals without household associations
6. **Added `assignOrphanedGoalsToHousehold()`** - Fixes orphaned goals
7. **Added `runGoalsDiagnostic()`** - Comprehensive diagnostic tool
8. **Enhanced Dashboard UI** - Better error messages and diagnostic interface

### How it works now:
- When you save a goal, it's properly associated with your household ID
- When you reload the app, it can find your household and retrieve your goals
- If household setup is missing, it's automatically created
- If goals exist but aren't associated, the diagnostic tool helps identify and fix the issue
- Enhanced error messages guide users through troubleshooting steps

## ADD "Expense Tracker" VIEW
The main landing page for this app should be an "Expense Tracker" view with the following features:
  [ ] Chips/Buttons for the most common stores (These stores are linked to a specific budget category, i.e. "Misc." or "Grocery" or "Gas")
  [ ] Very easy textfield entry for money spent, with an easy to touch "Submit" button
  [ ] Dynamically updated visual tracker by account of money spent out of the total amount alotted for that category (i.e. Grocery/Misc. has a budget amount of $800, so when I enter an expense of $50, the meter is reduced to $750 remaining of the 800 budget)
  [ ] Auto-save when clicking "Submit"
  [ ] A reset/finalize button that, when clicked, finalizes that pay period info in the Google Sheet (for archival and data analysis purposes) and refreshes the budget meters
  [ ] an edit button icon to add/edit/remove budget categories and alotted amounts
  [ ] This needs to link to the google sheet tab named "Expense Tracker" 
      [ ] Household ID (so any member linked to the household can submit expenses and all the data is shared dynamically with other household members)
      [ ] Location (This is the store or place the household member spent the money.  This location will have an assigned budget category -- i.e. "Trader Joe's" is assigned to "Grocery & Miscellaneous", "Gas Station" is assigned to "Gas", etc..  The Locations and Budget Categories will be tracked in the spreadsheet tab named "Budget Categories", column A will be "Locations" and I will list out the stores I go to (but will need an option to "Add other" that then writes the fill-in option to the sheet in the next open cell of column A) and column B will be "Budget Category" and it will be a dropdown with 2 options -- "Grocery/Misc." and "Gas".  I will add additional categories when necessary so there should be an "Other category" option in the web app wehre whne I add a new one, it is added to the options in the dropdown of column B)
      [ ] Budget Category (this is the budget category for the location)
      [ ] Amount Spent (This is the amount of money entered into the textfield by the user to say how much they spent at the location)
  [ ] The apps script should look for the correct tab by name and if it doesn't exist, it should automatically be created with the correct data mapping set up.

## MORNING GOAL SETTING FOR HABITS
For the positive habits (basically anything except the Negative category from the "Points Reference" tab of the spreadsheet), I'd like a way to select the ones I hope to achieve that day, receiving a bonus for the ones I do complete and a penalty for the ones I don't.
  [ ] This needs to be very easy and well organized.  The selections I make for the daily goal need to lock at like 9am or something so it's not so easy to go back on my goal, you know?
  [ ] There should be an email encouragement or something around dinner time that looks at the habits that have not yet been selected (this relates to the update below) and emails the users of the household a friendly nudge about which ones they have yet to complete.
  [ ] There should be some type of reward for completing all, and then some kind of reduction for any of them that are not completed.
  [ ] In a perfect world, the daily habit goals would be linked to some kind of visual -- like a baby plant -- and as I complete my goal, we see the plant grow a little bit bigger and bigger until it's a tree.  When I miss a goal, it should move the opposite way and start wilting as if it isn't being taken care of.
  [ ] The daily goals need to reset overnight, but the plant data needs to be saved so it's a constant and dynamic representation of ones work. 
  [ ] The apps script should look for the correct tab by name and if it doesn't exist, it should automatically be created with the correct data mapping set up.

## AUTO SUBMITTED HABIT TRACKING AT NIGHT VS MANUAL USER-ENTRIES
Currently the app requires a user to select their habits in the web app and click submit each time, thus the apps script needing to find all entries of the same date and compile them.  I would like the flow to be wher ethe user can load the web app and select any habits they have completed and then leave the app (without having to then click anything more or even submit), then whent hey load the web app later (within that same day) the previously selected habits are still selected so they could add additional habits and/or increment already-selected habits.
  [ ] Saved session states, resetting after auto-submission at 10pm
  [ ] Auto-submission of selected habits at 10pm
  [ ] All household members should see the same habits selected (if household member 1 selects exercise, whne household member 2 loads the web app, exercise is selected, etc.)
  [ ] Ensure households only have one submission per household (even though household members 1 and 2 load the web app and see the same habits, we cannot have both members submit because then it will duplicate the submissions.  Household member 1 should be the one that gets submitted, but Household member 2 needs the ability to select/deselect activies.)
